            Smith's influences include Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Kurt Cobain and Tycho.[57] Smith also considers his father, Will Smith, as an inspiration saying "He started in music and transitioned to movies. I started with movies, and then I transitioned into making music â€“ I look at him and use it as a blueprint of how good of a person he is, but not necessarily the success that he reached."[57]
